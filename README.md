# Star Citizen BulkXPLOR modified

This project aims to add Bulk Melting and Gifting functionality to the [HangarXPLOR] plugin.

It helps to improve the default Hangar page at https://robertsspaceindustries.com/account/pledges.

WARNING: This plugin has been split off from the original HangarXPLOR, as it adds functionality which requires your password to work. As such, this plugin WILL ask for your password, when you are melting or gifting ships, but at no stage is this password ever stored, or sent to any non-RSI websites.

Current features include:
* Add bulk Melt button
* Add bulk Gift button

# Installation Instructions

This plugin will only work if [HangarXPLOR](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/star-citizen-hangar-xplor/bhkgemjdepodofcnmekdobmmbifemhkc) is already installed.

# Browser Support 

* [Google Chrome Extension]
